# Online Portfolio Selection

- **Introduction**

    Online portfolio selection is a financial technology concept focusing on the design and implementation of algorithms to manage and optimize investment portfolios over time using online financial data.

    In finance, a portfolio refers to a collection of financial investments like stocks, bonds, commodities, cash, and cash equivalents, including closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Investors aim to balance their portfolios based on their risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon to optimize their returns.
